Topic - Planetary Health Dashboard
Description - The Planetary Health Dashboard aims to centralize and visualize real-time environmental data, addressing the urgent need 
              for accessible insights into Earth’s health. As the planet faces rapid changes—like rising temperatures, deforestation, and 
              species extinction—data remains fragmented and hard to interpret. This project will consolidate critical indicators such as 
              climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and ecosystem trends into one interactive, visually engaging dashboard. Using 
              live feeds from satellites, sensors, and open APIs, the dashboard will inform, educate, and inspire action through clear 
              visual storytelling.
